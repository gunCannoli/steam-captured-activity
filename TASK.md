# TASK — current status & what's next

Lean tracker: **open work only.** Everything shipped — with verification logs
and rationale — lives in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) (workspace) and each
plugin's own `CHANGELOG.md`. ADRs are in [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md),
Steam internals in [docs/steam-components.md](docs/steam-components.md). Don't
duplicate that detail here — link to it.

**Goal:** a non-Steam game's app detail page looks like a native one, on both
desktop and Big Picture, by restoring Steam's own sections and feeding Steam's
own stores — not by rebuilding the page ([ADR-0022](docs/decisions.md#adr-0022-render-through-steams-own-app-detail-sections-instead-of-rebuilding-them)).
`enhanced-achievements` and `enhanced-notifications` are separate plugins that
theme Steam's toasts and sounds.

## Alpha testing (user)

Only verifiable with a real game running. Steps and expected results:
[phase7-and-alpha-plan.md § User test checklist](docs/plans/phase7-and-alpha-plan.md#user-test-checklist-only-the-user-can-verify)
and each plugin's README ("How to test").

- [ ] **U1–U5:** real-unlock captures — screenshot, clip, coalescing, Steam's own
      achievement marker, non-Steam shortcut via "Test captures".
- [ ] **U6:** no captures when in-game toasts are disabled (settings warning shows).
- [ ] **U7:** in-game overlay, both plugins (desktop overlay toasts should be caught
      via `g_PopupManager`; Big Picture overlay toasts are code-verified only).
- [ ] **U8:** `enhanced-notifications` friends/messages styling with Steam's Friends
      notifications on (currently SKIP in `tests/categories.mjs`).
- [ ] **U9:** fresh install from a `dev.ps1 -Package` zip under the release name.

## Blocked upstream

- [ ] **Millennium Configuration API bug** [#903](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium/issues/903)
      (fix proposed in [PR #904](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium/pull/904)).
      Once a fixed release ships, re-test and drop the workaround in both plugins' `settings.ts`.

## Roadmap

### steam-cartridges (merger + buckets + achievements)

Plan only, no code yet: [docs/steam-cartridges.md](docs/steam-cartridges.md). Phases:

- [ ] **P0** research closure + ADRs · [ ] **P1** merge `non-steam-games-activity` + `steamgriddb-artwork` · [ ] **P2** exclusive bucket engine · [ ] **P3** Steam Store bucket · [ ] **P4** hardening · [ ] **P5** achievements (Steam native, RetroAchievements) · [ ] **P6** optional SteamGridDB rules

Phase 5 below is superseded by P5 there.

### Phase 5: Native Achievement Integration (Desktop & Big Picture)

- **Desktop Sidebar:** Re-enable `"achievements"` in `CAppDetailsSections.GetSections()` and feed `AppDetailsStore.GetAchievements(appid)` with `{ nAchieved, nTotal, vecHighlight, vecUnachieved }`.
- **Post-Game Summary:** Feed `CGamePlaySession.prototype.AddAchievement(achievement, unlockTime)` so unlocked achievements appear in the summary card strip alongside screenshots and clips.
- **Big Picture Play Bar:** Feed `appAchievementProgressCache.m_achievementProgress.mapCache` with `{ unlocked, total }` so quick stats display under the Play button.
- **Data Adapters:** Ingest schemas and unlocks from local emulator sources (RPCS3 `TROPCONF.SFM`/`TROPUSR.DAT`, RetroArch/rcheevos logs, DuckStation, PCSX2) and generic JSON.

### Phase 9: Provider Contract & Multi-Plugin Architecture

- Formalize the provider IPC contract (`retroachievements`, `steamgriddb`, `retroarch`) adhering to [ADR-0013](docs/decisions.md#adr-0013-providers-return-data-the-core-renders-it) and [ADR-0014](docs/decisions.md#adr-0014-providers-are-isolated-and-fail-silently).

## Before writing any UI

Check whether Steam already builds it — the ladder is in
[docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md#build-nothing-steam-already-builds). Restoring a filtered-out section beat
a from-scratch rebuild by ~1200 lines once already
([ADR-0022](docs/decisions.md#adr-0022-render-through-steams-own-app-detail-sections-instead-of-rebuilding-them)).
The inspection method (CDP harness, traps, how to verify) is in
[steam-debug.md § 3 The inspection method](docs/steam-debug.md#3-the-inspection-method).
